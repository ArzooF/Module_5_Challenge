# Module_5_Challenge
-- Module 5 project demonstrated the use of Matplotlib to visualize data and analyze the effectiveness of the Capomulin treatment regimen.
-- The study involved 249 mice with SCC tumors treated with various drug regimens, observed over 45 days.
-- As a senior data analyst, my task was to generate tables and figures for the technical report and summarize the study results.
-- The analysis included merging datasets, cleaning data, generating summary statistics, and creating various plots.
-- Bar charts and pie charts were created to visualize the distribution of data across different treatment regimens and genders.
-- Quartiles were calculated, outliers identified, and box plots generated for the final tumor volume of Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin treatment groups.
-- A line plot was generated to track tumor volume changes over time for a specific mouse (1509) treated with Capomulin.
-- A scatter plot was created to explore the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume under the Capomulin regimen.
-- Correlation and regression analyses were performed to quantify the relationship between weight and tumor volume.
-- All visualizations and statistical analyses helped understand the effectiveness of Capomulin and factors influencing tumor growth.
